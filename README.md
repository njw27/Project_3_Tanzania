 This is why identifying false positives is so important and is why we decided on precision as our evaluation metric.

## Conclusion

From this figure it can be seen that inland, on the southern Tanzanian boarder, there are many wells in need of repair. You can also see few functioning wells in this same area meaning these communities will have to travel farther to get access to drinking water. Regions like these definitely should be focused on when considering where to immediately begin aid.
